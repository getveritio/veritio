/**
 * Optional cloud ship-out: wraps the local evidence sink so every locally
 * committed gateway event is also enqueued into a durable outbox for async
 * delivery to a Veritio ingest endpoint (`@veritio/storage`'s HTTP outbox
 * dispatcher drains it on the host's retry interval).
 *
 * Ordering invariant (rule 09): the LOCAL append is the authoritative write
 * and must succeed first; the enqueue is a best-effort post-success
 * follow-up. An enqueue failure never fails the request, never touches the
 * health gate, and logs one sanitized warning — the local chain remains
 * complete, so nothing is lost, only not mirrored. Retries are idempotent:
 * the enqueued event carries the locally assigned record id, and the ingest
 * endpoint deduplicates by record id (server re-redacts and re-chains).
