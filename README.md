# Veritio

Veritio is a protocol-first open-source evidence layer for application audit
trails, consent history events, data subject workflow evidence, retention
events, records of processing support, evidence graphs, and exportable records.

It provides language-neutral schemas, TypeScript/Python/Go SDKs, thin framework
adapters, host-injected storage helpers, local Workbench/MCP tooling, and
conformance fixtures. Veritio supports evidence collection and verification; it
is not legal advice and does not make an application automatically compliant
with GDPR, EAA, SOC 2, HIPAA, DORA, NIS2, or any other framework.

## What Is Implemented

- Language-neutral audit event and evidence-edge schemas in `spec/`.
- Append-only audit and edge record envelopes with canonical JSON, SHA-256
  hashes, previous-hash links, and tenant-scoped idempotency.
- TypeScript, Python, and Go SDKs for event/edge creation, canonicalization,
  hashing, redaction, and shared audit templates.
- TypeScript-only audit storage and provenance helpers, including the
  `createProvenanceRecorder` agent/change recorder.
- Public JavaScript packages for Better Auth, Next.js, TanStack Start,
  SvelteKit, React, Vue, Svelte, storage helpers, Claude Code capture, and the
  local CLI.
- In-repo private server and adapter shells for self-hosted/server-side surfaces
  that are not yet public npm packages.
- Local Workbench and MCP development loop through `veritio dev --mcp`.
- Runnable examples for Better Auth across frameworks, Python FastAPI, Go Gin,
  storage adapters, and optional hosted-ingest delivery.

## Install

Public package names are stable, but this repository is still pre-1.0. Use local
workspace links while developing inside this repo.

```sh
npm install @veritio/core
npm install @veritio/storage
npm install @veritio/better-auth
npm install -D veritio
```

```sh
pip install veritio
go get github.com/getveritio/veritio/sdks/go
```

Inside this monorepo:

```sh
bun install
bun run verify
```

## TypeScript Quick Start

Use `@veritio/core` when you want normalized event and edge payloads plus
deterministic hashes. The in-memory `MemoryAuditStore` persists audit events
only; use the local Workbench/server or file-backed store when you need event
and edge chains.

```ts
import {
  MemoryAuditStore,
  createAuditEvent,
  createEvidenceEdge,
  hashEvidenceEdge,
} from "@veritio/core";

const store = new MemoryAuditStore();

const event = createAuditEvent({
  id: "evt_01",
  occurredAt: "2026-06-10T00:00:00.000Z",
  actor: { type: "user", id: "usr_123" },
  action: "org.member.invited",
  target: { type: "organization", id: "org_123" },
  scope: { tenantId: "org_123", environment: "production" },
  purpose: "access_management",
  lawfulBasis: "contract",
  retention: "security_1y",
  metadata: { inviteId: "inv_123", role: "viewer" },
});

const record = await store.append(event);

const edge = createEvidenceEdge({
  id: "edge_01",
  occurredAt: "2026-06-10T00:00:01.000Z",
  scope: { tenantId: "org_123", environment: "production" },
  from: { type: "actor", id: "usr_123", actorType: "user" },
  relation: "created",
  to: { type: "runtime_event", id: event.id },
  metadata: { reason: "member_invite" },
});

const edgeHash = hashEvidenceEdge(edge, record.hash);
```

## Local Workbench

Run the OSS local Workbench and MCP endpoint without a hosted account:

```sh
veritio dev --mcp --scenario
```

The default server binds `http://127.0.0.1:4983` and exposes:

- event and edge ingest/list endpoints
- evidence graph query
- chain verification
- export bundle preview
- browser Workbench UI
- MCP JSON-RPC endpoint at `/mcp`

MCP read tools are available by default. Write tools such as
`veritio.record_event`, `veritio.record_edge`, and `veritio.reset_dev_store`
are hidden unless the CLI is started with `--allow-write-tools`.

## Protocol Invariants

The public protocol lives in `spec/` and conformance fixtures live in
`spec/conformance/`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spec/event.schema.json` | Audit event payload, schema version `2026-06-10`. |
| `spec/edge.schema.json` | Evidence graph edge payload, schema version `2026-06-13`. |
| `spec/audit-record.schema.json` | Append-only record envelope for events. |
| `spec/edge-record.schema.json` | Append-only record envelope for edges. |
| `spec/conformance/*.json` | Cross-language vectors for canonical JSON, hashing, redaction, event creation, and edge creation. |

Protocol-sensitive behavior:

- Canonical JSON version is `veritio-json-v1`.
- Hash algorithm is `sha256`.
- Persisted record hashes use `sha256(veritio-json-v1(record without hash))`.
- Event hashes use `sha256(veritio-json-v1({ event, previousHash }))`.
- Edge hashes use `sha256(veritio-json-v1({ edge, previousHash }))`.
- Idempotency key hashes use `sha256(tenantId + NUL + idempotencyKey)`.
- Stored audit and edge records require tenant scope and fail closed when
  required integrity data is missing.
- Metadata redaction is deterministic and based on sensitive key names such as
  password, secret, token, API key, authorization, email, phone, and SSN.

Consent, data subject request, retention, organization, auth, agent, code, CI,
deployment, and export flows are currently represented through templates,
actions, graph entities, and graph relations. They are not separate workflow
schemas in `spec/` yet.

## Language Parity

TypeScript, Python, and Go share the same protocol semantics for:

- audit event creation
- evidence edge creation
- canonical JSON normalization
- event, edge, audit-record, and edge-record hashing
- sensitive metadata redaction
- UTC millisecond timestamp normalization
- optional-field omission
- auth, organization, data, agent, and code audit templates

The TypeScript SDK currently has extra runtime helpers: `MemoryAuditStore`,
audit/edge chain verification helpers, and the TS-only `createProvenanceRecorder`
for agent and change provenance. Python and Go must preserve the same event and
edge semantics when those higher-level recorders are added.

## Storage

`@veritio/storage` is host-injected. It does not open database connections, read
environment variables, or own credentials.

Durable store helpers:

- `createPostgresAuditStore`
- `createNeonAuditStore`
- `createMysqlAuditStore`
- `createMariaDbAuditStore`
- `createMongoAuditStore`

Local and cache helpers:

- `createFileEvidenceStore` writes tenant-scoped event and edge JSONL chains for
  local hooks, agent provenance, and reference MCP workflows.
- `createRedisAuditTipCache` stores validated tenant chain tips only; Redis is
  not a durable audit store by itself.
- `@veritio/storage/conformance` exports
  `createAuditStoreConformanceTests` for durable adapter tests.

## Examples

Start with `examples/README.md`.

- `nextjs-better-auth`, `tanstack-start-better-auth`,
  `react-better-auth`, `vue-better-auth`, and `sveltekit-better-auth` show
  server-side Better Auth lifecycle events, governed CRUD, graph edges, and
  scenario routes.
- `fastapi-governed-crud` and `gin-governed-crud` show the same ideas in Python
  FastAPI and Go Gin.
- `storage-postgres-neon`, `storage-mysql-mariadb`, `storage-mongodb`, and
  `storage-redis` show host-injected storage setup.
- `cloud-full-governance-poc` can post the same SDK-created evidence to a
  hosted ingest endpoint when a host supplies scoped credentials.

Examples are verified separately from the root workspace:

```sh
bun run verify:examples
```

## Repository Boundary

This repository owns the public OSS foundation:

- language-neutral specs
- TypeScript, Python, and Go SDKs
- framework adapters
- host-injected storage helpers
- local/self-hosted server modules
- local Workbench and MCP tooling
- verifier and export bundle format
- conformance fixtures and public examples

Sibling repositories own other surfaces:

- `veritio-website`: public Astro website, docs pages, SEO metadata, marketing
  copy, public examples, and static assets.
- `veritio-cloud`: private hosted SaaS/PaaS implementation, hosted ingest,
  hosted MCP, managed storage, billing, regions, customer portals, admin, and
  operational jobs.

Hosted Veritio must consume this repo through public package boundaries or
explicit local development links. Hosted-only fields, billing concepts, region
behavior, private admin operations, and customer portal details must not become
protocol semantics.

must not be committed or copied into public docs.

## Verification

Primary OSS gate:

```sh
bun run verify
```

Focused gates:

```sh
bun run test:ts
bun run test:python
bun run test:go
bun run test:storage
bun run test:adapters

bun run verify:examples
git diff --check
```

Split-repo coordination from this control repo:

```sh
bun run status:split
bun run verify:siblings
bun run verify:split
```

Use `bun run verify:split` for changes that span the OSS repo, the website
sibling, and the hosted cloud sibling.
