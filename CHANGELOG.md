# Changelog

All notable changes to Veritio will be documented in this file.

Veritio is a pre-1.0 Apache-2.0 project. Early releases may change APIs while the protocol, SDKs, adapters, and storage contracts settle. Release notes should be explicit about migration steps and should avoid legal-compliance guarantees.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Published Node-compatible ESM specifiers for `@veritio/core` export-bundle
  helpers. `@veritio/core`, `@veritio/storage`, and `@veritio/claude-code`
  were released together; `@veritio/claude-code` now pins the `0.4.1` core and
  storage packages.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Evidence export bundles (`vevb-1`): a portable, offline-verifiable container
  that indexes tamper-evident record files under a signed manifest.
  `@veritio/core` gains `buildExportBundle` (deterministic, clock-free assembly
  of audit/edge/commit records into fixed `records/*.jsonl` files plus an
  embedded `verification.json`), `computeRootHash`, `serializeExportBundle` /
  `parseExportBundle` (canonical single-file container), `signExportBundle`
  (Ed25519 detached signature over the manifest digest), and
  `verifyExportBundle` (fail-closed structure/integrity/chains/signature gates).
- `veritio verify-bundle <file> [--public-key <path>] [--require-signature]
  [--json]` CLI command: reads a container, runs the offline verifier, prints
  per-gate results and a `VALID`/`INVALID` verdict, and exits non-zero on
  failure. Public keys are accepted as raw 32-byte, hex, or base64.
- MCP `create_export_bundle` now emits a `vevb-1` bundle.
- Normative format spec `spec/export-bundle.md`, container/manifest/signature
  JSON Schema `spec/export-bundle.schema.json`, and pinned conformance fixtures
  `spec/conformance/export-bundle-golden.json` (a complete signed bundle over
  real record envelopes) and `spec/conformance/export-bundle-tampered.json` (the
  same bytes with one record byte flipped). Both carry the raw verifying public
  key as hex so any implementation can reproduce the verdict offline.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-05

`@veritio/core` 0.2.0, `@veritio/storage` 0.2.0, `@veritio/claude-code` 0.2.0
(released together; claude-code pins the others exactly). No breaking protocol
changes in this release: default-policy scoring output is byte-identical to
0.1.x, and all pre-existing conformance fixtures and frozen hash anchors are
unchanged.

### Added

- Temperature-derived risk policies: `riskPolicy({ temperature, overrides })`
  (`risk_policy` in Python, `RiskPolicy` in Go) derives a full
  `RiskScoringPolicy` from `veritio.reference.v1`. Temperature is a multiple of
  0.01 in `[0,1]`; `0.5` reproduces the reference policy byte-for-byte; derived
  versions look like `veritio.reference.v1+temp0.70`. Overrides merge after
  derivation and require an explicit `policyVersion` (fail closed). Pinned by
  `spec/conformance/risk-policy-temperature.json`.
- Per-action frequency rules in the episode rollup:
  `policy.rollup.frequencyRules` (`{ actions, windowSeconds, threshold, boost }`)
  detects bursts such as repeated failed logins; rules fire once per episode and
  the rollup score becomes `max(peak, velocityScore, frequencyScore)`. Rollup
  steps accept an optional `action`; policies without rules emit byte-identical
  pre-0.2.0 output. Pinned by `spec/conformance/risk-episode-frequency.json`.
- Better Auth adapter security mappers: `recordLoginFailed`
  (`auth.login.failed`) and `recordAccessDenied` (`authz.access.denied`) —
  translation-only, PII-safe (the attempted email is never recorded).
- Normative prose spec `spec/risk-scoring.md`; full policy field reference and
  temperature/frequency documentation in `docs/risk-scoring.md`; risk-scoring
  README sections for the Python and Go SDKs.
- `examples/risk-scoring-walkthrough`: tested walkthrough driving the real
  Better Auth adapter (burst escalates to `critical`, the same actions spread
  out stay `low`).
- Agent Skills for coding agents (`skills/veritio-audit-trail`,
  `skills/veritio-risk-scoring`), installable via
  `npx skills add getveritio/veritio`.

### Accumulated earlier items (shipped across the 0.1.x releases; the changelog was not cut at 0.1.0/0.1.1)

- OSS hygiene scaffold for contribution workflow, security disclosure, GitHub issue templates, pull request review, and release checks.
- Shared protocol conformance fixtures for canonical JSON, event creation, redaction, event hashing, audit record hashing, and idempotency-key hashing across TypeScript, Python, and Go tests.
- Runner-neutral storage conformance tests for durable `AuditStore` adapters.
- Env-gated live storage conformance tests for Postgres-compatible stores, the Neon factory, MySQL, MariaDB, and MongoDB.
- Runnable Next.js App Router plus Better Auth reference example with server-owned tenant and actor context.
- Deterministic cross-language risk-signal scoring (`risk.ts` / `risk.py` / `risk.go`) with the `DEFAULT_RISK_POLICY` reference policy (`veritio.reference.v1`), pinned by `spec/conformance` fixtures. See `docs/risk-scoring.md`.
- `security.risk` assertion builders (`createSecurityRiskAssertion`, `buildSecurityRiskAssessedEvent`, `hashAssertionRecord`) and the `activity_episode` evidence entity type plus the `activity.episode.started` lifecycle event/template.
- `activityEpisodeId` threading: stamped on every session event by the recorder (parity with `metadata.sessionId`), captured per session by `@veritio/claude-code`, and surfaced on the Better Auth example agent-session UIs.
- Local server `recordAssertion` / `listAssertions`: stores a precomputed `security.risk` assertion verbatim and links it to its subject by a `based_on` edge (the server is a sink and never scores).

### Changed

- Storage package exports `@veritio/storage/conformance` for external database adapter checks.
- Postgres/Neon and MySQL/MariaDB example schemas now match the storage adapter column contract.
- **BREAKING:** removed `riskScore` from the session security context (Better Auth adapter `BetterAuthSessionSecurityContext`, and the TypeScript/Python/Go `SessionSecurityContext` templates). Hosts now record a structured `riskSignals` envelope that the SDK scores deterministically. Migration: replace the numeric `riskScore` on the security context with a `riskSignals` envelope on event metadata via `withRiskSignals` (`with_risk_signals` in Python, `WithRiskSignals` in Go).

### Fixed

- Nothing yet.

### Security

- Nothing yet.

## Release Note Guidelines

For each release, include:

- protocol, schema, canonical JSON, hash, idempotency, redaction, retention, or storage-ordering changes
- TypeScript, Python, and Go SDK compatibility notes
- adapter and storage helper changes
- package publishing notes for public packages
- migration steps for breaking or behavior-affecting changes
- security fixes or disclosure references when public

Use evidence-support language. Do not claim that a Veritio release provides legal advice or automatic compliance with any regulation or framework.
